On a lot of systems, you should be able to connect to it as root (the mysql root user) with no password:

 $ mysql -u root

Once you get access to the database, you should be able to navigate it using the following queries:

    show databases;
    use [DATABASE];
    show tables;
    select * from [TABLE];

Where [DATABASE] and [TABLE] should be replaced by the value from the previous queries.
